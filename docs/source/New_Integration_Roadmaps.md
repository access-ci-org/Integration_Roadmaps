# Make a New ACCESS Integration Roadmap

If you want to integrate a cyberinfrastructure resource into the ACCESS
ecosystem and no existing integration roadmap seems appropriate for your
resources, you may want to propose a new ACCESS integration roadmap.
This page explains the benefits of an integration roadmap and how to
create a new one. At the end of this page, you\'ll find a link to begin
the process of creating a new integration roadmap, but please review the
information here first.

**What does it mean to integrate a cyberinfrastructure resource with
ACCESS?** For most resources, integration with ACCESS means
participating in one or more of ACCESS\'s coordination services. These
coordination services (listed below) make the ACCESS
ecosystem\-\--including the individual resources within it\-\--easier
for researchers to understand and use.

An ACCESS integration roadmap details the ACCESS coordination services
most appropriate for a specific kind of cyberinfastructure resource and
the steps a resource provider must take to participate in them.

## Steps for Creating a New ACCESS Integration Roadmap

The rest of this guide will fill in the details, but here\'s an overview
of the steps for creating a new ACCESS Integration Roadmap.

1.  Inform the ACCESS Infrastructure Integration Steering Committee
    (IISC) that you are beginning to work on an integration roadmap for
    a new kind of ACCESS-integrated cyberinfrastucture resource.
2.  Form a working group to help you identify the necessary pieces of
    the integration roadmap.
3.  Draft the integration roadmap, by copying tasks from other roadmaps
    and defining tasks specific to the new type of resource.
4.  Publish the new integration roadmap in ACCESS\'s integration roadmap
    library.
5.  Announce the new integration roadmap.

## Why Create a New ACCESS Integration Roadmap?

If you\'re adding the first resource of a type that has never been
integrated with ACCESS before, there won\'t be an existing integration
roadmap for you to follow. Creating a new roadmap offers the following
benefits.

1.  It will help you take advantage of the coordination services ACCESS
    has to offer. Once you decide which services will add value to your
    resource, the roadmap can help you keep track of your progress as
    you work with each coordination service.
2.  It will give other resource providers a sensible roadmap for adding
    their resources to ACCESS.
3.  As more resources like yours are added to ACCESS, researchers using
    these resources will benefit from appropriate commonalities provided
    by the integration roadmap. ACCESS-integrated resources will work in
    similar ways when it\'s helpful.

If it isn\'t likely there will ever be other resources like yours in
ACCESS, you can use the information below to plan your integration
without actually creating an integration roadmap.

## ACCESS\'s Coordination Services

The major coordination services ACCESS currently offers are listed
below. Each service provides benefits to both researchers and resource
providers. You should review this list and decide which of these
services would help you achieve your goals for ACCESS integration.

-   **ACCESS Resource Discovery:** An ACCESS-wide searchable/browseable
    directory of resources. Having a resource listed in ACCESS\'s
    resource directory provides greater visibility for the resource,
    helping resource providers recruit new users. Researchers have a
    convenient place to look for resources they can use to carry out
    their research projects.
-   **ACCESS Allocations:** A system for requesting permission to use
    resources in support of research projects. Resource providers can
    use this to recruit new and returning users for their resources.
    Researchers use this to gain access to additional resources for
    their research projects.
-   **CONECTnet:** Wide area network for efficient and resilient data
    transfer and novel network applications across the ACCESS ecosystem.
    Resource providers benefit from a high-performance, resilient
    network connection for their resources. Researchers benefit from
    advanced network connectivity between ACCESS resources.
-   **ACCESS Coordinated User Support:** ACCESS-wide services for
    providing technical support to researchers. Researchers benefit from
    a single place to request help when using any ACCESS resource.
    Resource providers benefit from being able to collaborate with other
    ACCESS personnel on user support when issues involve ACCESS services
    or another ACCESS resource.
-   **ACCESS Metrics and Monitoring:** An ACCESS-wide service for
    gathering and presenting resource usage metrics. Researchers have a
    single place to go to find out how much they\'ve used of ACCESS
    resources and compare it to overall use. Resource providers get a
    standardized way to report use of their resources to sponsors and
    other stakeholders.
-   **ACCESS Single Sign-On:** ACCESS-wide user identities and
    authentication service. Reseachers have a single ID to use with all
    ACCESS resources and single sign-on across ACCESS websites and
    resources. Resource providers can use ACCESS IDs and authentication
    rather than maintaining local accounts and user credentials
    (passwords, keys).

## Inform the ACCESS Infrastructure Integration Steering Committee (IISC)

After you\'ve reviewed this guide and decided that you want to propose a
new integration roadmap, the first step is to inform the Infrastructure
Integration Steering Committee (IISC). The last section of this guide
provides the link you can follow to formally notify the IISC.

The IISC includes representatives of ACCESS\'s operations team and
project management. Their main purpose is to make sure you have the
resources you need to accomplish your objective. These resources
include: ACCESS project contacts and introductions, documentation, and
access to our shared Google Drive. A liaison from the IISC will contact
you to review your plans and offer assistance. After meeting with you,
the liaison will inform the ACCESS Executive Council (EC) about your
plan so they can prepare their project areas to provide the resources
you\'ll need.

## Form a Working Group

When creating a new ACCESS integration roadmap, it\'s important to get
input from ACCESS service providers and\-\--if possible\-\--from other
resource providers who are likely to follow the roadmap. A good way to
get that input is to form a working group. ACCESS working groups allow
stakeholders from the ACCESS projects and resources provider
organizations to meet regularly to work together on a common goal. For
example, you can launch a working group to create a new integration
roadmap, invite stakeholders from the relevant areas in ACCESS, and when
the roadmap is completed, the working group ends.

Creating a working group is easy. The first step is to draft a
*charter*. The charter defines the working group and has the following
elements.

-   A name for the working group
-   An initial chairperson (two chairpersons is also fine)
-   A one-paragraph statement of the working group\'s purpose
-   A list of specific goals
-   A list of stakeholders
-   A tentative timeline for deliverables

*Stakeholders* are people who have or may have an interest in the
outcome of the working group or who have expertise that the working
group needs. For example, you will likely need representatives from the
major ACCESS project areas and new or prospective ACCESS resource
providers. *Deliverables* are concrete things the working group will
produce, such as a new integration roadmap.

When you have your charter document, review it with your project
leadership and make certain they approve of you working on it. Then,
send a note to your IISC liaison (see previous section) so he or she can
inform the ACCESS Executive Committee of the new working group. (The
Executive Committee needs to know because you\'ll likely need
representatives from their projects to participate as stakeholders in
the working group.)

Once your charter is approved, create a new folder for the working group
within the [ACCESS Working
Groups](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1udqxZ_IjWP8n3lSWZZze8IrFmeB-g2CV)
Google Drive folder. Add the charter document. Review the [ACCESS
cross-track technical coordination
schedule](https://access-ci.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ACP/pages/9502721/Cross-Track+Technical+Coordination+Schedule)
to find a good time for the first meeting and ask on the ACCESS-CI
slack\'s #access-wide channel if anyone is using the two most-likely
options, just in case. Create a new document in the working group Google
Drive folder for meeting agendas and notes and include the date, time,
and coordinates for the first meeting. (It\'s helpful to keep all
meeting notes in a single document so they can be referenced during
meetings.)

Finally, draft an announcement for the working group that references the
charter, key stakeholders who you\'d like to have participate, agenda
for the first meeting, and meeting coordinates. Post the announcement on
the ACCESS-CI slack\'s #access-wide channel and the ACCESS-RP
Communications slack\'s #general channel. If you need participation by
current resource providers, ask the ACCESS Operations team to email your
announcement to all current resource provider contacts. Now you\'re
ready for your first working group meeting!

## What to Put In an Integration Roadmap

The audience of an ACCESS integration roadmap is a resource provider who
needs to integrate a new resource into the ACCESS ecosystem. Roadmaps
consist of a series of tasks that the resource provider must accomplish
in order to set things up with the appropriate ACCESS coordination
services. For the technical details on how to construct the files needed
for an integration roadmap and its tasks in GitHub, please see the
[Contributing
guide](https://github.com/access-ci-org/Integration_Roadmaps/blob/main/docs/contributing.md).

Most integration roadmaps have two types of tasks:

1.  Establishing personnel contacts
2.  Configuring and documenting software/services

In both cases, you\'ll need the ACCESS project representatives in your
working group to tell you what they need resource providers to do. This
should be the main topic in your working group meetings. Once you\'ve
described your resource and what makes it different from the current
resource types, the ACCESS area representatives should be able to
pinpoint tasks from other integration roadmaps that will be the same in
this new roadmap (and can be copied), tasks from other roadmaps that
don\'t seem applicable (and can be left out), and any new tasks that are
needed for this type of resource that haven\'t been necessary in other
roadmaps.

In regard to **personnel contacts**, ACCESS areas typically need the
resource provider to provide a list of contacts for specific functions.
It\'ll usually be a combination of management personnel (PIs, project
managers) and technical personnel (HPC system adminstrators, network
administrators, storage/data specialists, security personnel). Once all
of the ACCESS representatives in your working group have given you the
contacts they need, consolidate them into a single list and create a
task at the beginning of the roadmap so the resource provider can just
fill out a single form with all of the necessary contact information.

For **configuring and documenting software and services**, each ACCESS
project area will have its own list of ways resource providers can
engage with their area. It\'s very likely these will be similar to (or
even the same as) tasks in existing integration roadmaps, so the working
group representatives may only have to point to existing tasks in other
roadmaps and ask to have them included in your new roadmap. If the tasks
don\'t need to be customized, you can include them in your roadmap by
reference instead of making new copies. (Just be aware that if the task
is edited for another roadmap, those edits will also appear in your
roadmap.) If a task needs to be customized for this type of resource, or
if you don\'t want to take the chance that edits to the task in other
roadmaps also change the task in your roadmap, make a copy. But if you
make a copy, be aware that any improvements to the task\'s text in other
roadmaps won\'t be reflected in yours.

## Get an Integration Roadmap Reviewed and Approved

Assuming you have the right stakeholders represented in your working
group, you shouldn\'t need additional reviews or approvals once the
tasks have been finalized because everyone who is involved in the
roadmap will have been engaged already. Feedback from new resource
providers won\'t likely appear until your roadmap has been published and
announced. You can proceed directly to publishing and announcing your
roadmap!

## Publish and Maintain an Integration Roadmap

As outlined in the [Contributing
guide](https://github.com/access-ci-org/Integration_Roadmaps/blob/main/docs/contributing.md),
your new roadmap will consist of a pull request against the ACCESS
Integration Roadmaps GitHub repository. When you submit the pull
request, it will be reviewed by the ACCESS Operations team\'s Resource
Integration specialists. The goal of this review will be to ensure that
the ACCESS Operation team can support resource providers in carrying out
the tasks in your roadmap. If they have any questions or concerns, they
will respond to the pull request with a list of suggestions or requests.
Once the pull request is approved and merged, your roadmap will be
available to the ACCESS community!

As new resource providers use your integration roadmap, the ACCESS
Operations team will collect feedback in support tickets and other
channels. If changes are needed, they can be made through the process
outlined in the [Contributing
guide](https://github.com/access-ci-org/Integration_Roadmaps/blob/main/docs/contributing.md).

## Announce a New Integration Roadmap

Your new ACCESS integration roadmap will only be useful if people know
about it! We recommend the following ways to let relevant people know
about your roadmap.

1.  Post a link to it, including a brief blurb about what types of
    resources it\'s for, on the **ACCESS-CI** slack server\'s
    **#access-wide** channel.
2.  Post the same announcement on the **RP-ACCESS Communications** slack
    server\'s **#general** channel.
3.  Post a news item on the [ACCESS Infrastructure
    News](https://operations.access-ci.org/online_services/infrastructure_news)
    publishing service. This will result in a news story in ACCESS\'s
    staff newsletter and one or more news channels for resource
    providers and other community members.

## Get Started

If you\'re ready to get started on a new ACCESS integration roadmap, the
first step is to alert the ACCESS Infrastructure Integration Steering
