# ACCESS Allocated Production Storage

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

This roadmap integrates a storage resource. Researchers interact with storage by writing and reading data files from storage via storage interfaces.

## Summary

The ACCESS program ([*https://access-ci.org*](https://access-ci.org)) enables researchers and educators to gain access to advanced computing, visualization, and data resources to accomplish their research or classroom objectives using an allocations process described at [*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

This roadmap details the tasks that a resource provider must perform to make a specific storage system ACCESS allocated in production. These tasks cover all aspects of integration in production, including coordination activities, technical integration tasks, and ongoing support activities.

## Operator Information

Operators planning to integrate storage into ACCESS with this roadmap should contact ACCESS Operations to start the integration process. ACCESS Operations will assign a Concierge Integration Expert to provide personalized hands-on assistance with the integration process, schedule an online meeting between resource provider staff and ACCESS staff to launch the integration process, and provide instructions on how to track integration progress.

Operators must perform the Required Tasks below and may perform the Optional Tasks below.

See related [*Roadmap Task Timeline*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YUe7jamdhExo7TtouwidGs7V4opsgUWL1o8XLxc3ejk/edit?usp=share_link).

This roadmap refactors and replaces the [*ACCESS Allocated Production Compute/Storage/Cloud v1*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VUTa5DOz27B6wobZZwh6gh6dcXWD30rpYovoLZ1nwqk) roadmap. Operators that completed that roadmap only need to complete corresponding tasks that were not completed in the prior roadmap.

Please track RP integration progress in [*this spreadsheet*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejgGUU-IVLEhTIXX3pmCNBSJ2e0yXwXxPpgZ2RHwM4Q/). **\*NEEDS UPDATING\***

## Support Information

**Submit a Request**: Resource providers needing assistance with integration tasks can submit an *ACCESS Integration and Operation Support Request* using instructions on [*this page*](https://operations.access-ci.org/help). Pick an “*ACCESS Operations Issue Type*” that best matches your request, or the catch-all issue type “*ACCESS-wide: Provider Integration - Infrastructure Integration and Roadmaps*“.

**Slack Discussion**: ACCESS has a Slack channel for infrastructure operators and ACCESS to discuss integration topics. For access submit a request to be invited to the ***RP-ACCESS \#integration-roadmaps*** Slack channel.

**By Weekly Meetings**: ACCESS holds a Zoom meeting every second Friday from 11:00 AM to Noon Central for infrastructure operators and ACCESS to discuss integration topics. To obtain Zoom coordinates submit a request for the **RP and ACCESS Roadmaps** Zoom meeting coordinates.

**Integration Consultants**: ACCESS allocated resource providers and some other types of infrastructure operators have a *Concierge Integration Expert* consultant available for one-on-one integration support.
