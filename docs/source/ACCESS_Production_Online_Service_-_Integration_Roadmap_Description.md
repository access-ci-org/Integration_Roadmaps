# ACCESS Production Online Service

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

This roadmap integrates online services provided by ACCESS projects and their vendors / partners into the ACCESS operational environment. The roadmap is intended for online services that are visible outside a single ACCESS project, i.e. that need to be used by other ACCESS projects, resource providers, developers, or ACCESS users. Online services are accessed using a variety of network protocols suited for their function and target audience. Examples include ACCESS websites; Atlassian, GitHub, Google, and Globus services; DNS services; IAM services, and various APIs.

## Summary

This roadmap enumerates the tasks for integrating online services into the ACCESS environment for use by ACCESS users, resource providers, ACCESS projects, Science Gateways and other developers. These tasks cover all aspects of integration and operations into production, including coordination, technical integration, and ongoing support activities. The required tasks in this roadmap: describe the service so that it can be listed and discoverable in a consistent way; detail relevant ACCESS cybersecurity requirements, procedures, and best practices; provide service documentation to service users; establish service support ticketing channels; and communicate service availability changes. The optional tasksdetail ways to integrate that are available but not required.

## Operator Information

This roadmap was defined by ACCESS projects for use primarily by ACCESS projects. Since ACCESS projects participate in the roadmap process they should be able to follow this integration process without a hands on concierge. Operators must perform the Required Tasks below and may perform the Optional Tasks below.

See related [*Roadmap Task Timeline*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GIdAMNlJsCRMR1W3rXnD8IsLrY7qM5DLlFaLrKzAjRo/edit#slide=id.g1f134a7d5b4_1_5).

## Support Information

**Submit a Request**: Operators needing assistance with integration tasks can submit an *ACCESS Integration and Operation Support Request* using instructions on [*this page*](https://operations.access-ci.org/help). Pick an “*ACCESS Operations Issue Type*” that best matches your request, or the catch-all issue type “*ACCESS-wide: Provider Integration - Infrastructure Integration and Roadmaps*“.

**Slack Discussion**: ACCESS projects have a Slack channel for discussing the development and application of integration roadmaps. For access, talk to your projects’ participant in the Integration Roadmaps Working Group, or submit a request to be invited to the ***ACCESS-CI \#wg-integration-roadmaps*** Slack channel.
