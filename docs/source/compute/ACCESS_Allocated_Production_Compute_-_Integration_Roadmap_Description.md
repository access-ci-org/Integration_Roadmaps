# ACCESS Allocated Production Compute

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

This roadmap integrates a high-performance computing “HPC” cluster ([*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing)). Researchers typically use HPC clusters by logging in to front-end nodes where they install application software and run jobs under a batch scheduler. Science gateways, workflow engines and other software tools may perform these actions on the researchers' behalf. Jobs may run entirely in the background reading input data and generating output data, may use interactive or steered input, and may generate live or streamed visual output.

## Summary

The ACCESS program ([*https://access-ci.org*](https://access-ci.org)) enables researchers and educators to gain access to advanced computing, visualization, and data resources to accomplish their research or classroom objectives using an allocations process described at [*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

This roadmap details the tasks that a resource provider organization must perform to make a specific HPC cluster ACCESS allocated in production. These tasks cover all aspects of integration and operations in production, including coordination, technical integration tasks, and ongoing support activities.

## Operator Information

Operators planning to integrate an HPC resource into ACCESS with this roadmap should contact ACCESS Operations to start the integration process (see details in the first task below). ACCESS Operations will assign a Concierge Integration Expert to provide personalized hands-on assistance with the integration process, schedule an online meeting between resource provider staff and ACCESS staff to launch the integration process, and provide instructions on how to track integration progress.

Operators must perform the Required Tasks below and may perform the Optional Tasks below.

See related [*Roadmap Task Timeline*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vtt-Rvwa2ZVRp61A9g80MyisZ748lK1o_46Xt7-6Fq0/).
