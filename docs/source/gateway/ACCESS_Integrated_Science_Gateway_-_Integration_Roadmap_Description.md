# ACCESS Integrated Science Gateway

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

A science portal or science gateway is a community-developed set of tools, applications, and data integrated through a web-based portal or a suite of applications. They provide access to tools used in cutting-edge research â€“ telescopes, seismic shake tables, supercomputers, sky surveys, undersea sensors, and more. These gateways often connect diverse resources and make them easily accessible, lowering the barriers traditionally required to access these resources.

This roadmap integrates a science gateway service ([*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_gateway*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_gateway)). Science gateways provide web-based interfaces that link advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) components to enhance usability. The CI components linked by a science gateway differ based on specific user community needs, but can consist of one or more of the following components: High performance computing (HPC), data management, cloud-based resources, high throughput computing (HTC), user management, and authentication, authorization, and other security services.

## Summary

The ACCESS program ([*https://access-ci.org*](https://access-ci.org)) enables researchers and educators to gain access to advanced computing, visualization, and data resources to accomplish their research or classroom objectives using an allocations process described at [*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

This roadmap details the tasks that a gateway providing organization must perform to make their gateway operational within the ACCESS environment. These tasks cover all aspects of integration and production operations of the gateway, including coordination, technical integration tasks, and ongoing support activities.

If you are interested in seeing more support directly on your science gateway, you can contact the Science Gateways Center of Excellence for technical support, usability consulting, and other community support. Apply for support at [https://sciencegateways.org/work-with-us](https://sciencegateways.org/work-with-us). 

## Operator Information

Operators planning to integrate a science gateway into ACCESS with this roadmap should contact ACCESS Operations to start the integration process (see details in the first task below). ACCESS Operations will assign a Concierge Integration Expert to provide personalized hands-on assistance with the integration process, schedule an online meeting between the gateway provider staff and ACCESS staff to launch the integration process, and provide instructions on how to track the integration progress.

Operators must perform the Required Tasks below and may perform the Optional Tasks below.
