# ACCESS Production Online Service

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

This roadmap integrates online services provided by ACCESS projects and their vendors / partners into the ACCESS operational environment. The roadmap is intended for online services that are visible outside a single ACCESS project and used by other ACCESS projects, resource providers, developers, or ACCESS users. Online services are accessed using a variety of network protocols suited for their function and target audience. Examples include ACCESS websites; Atlassian, GitHub, Google, and Globus services; DNS services; IAM services, and various APIs.

## Summary

This roadmap enumerates the tasks for integrating online services into the ACCESS environment for use by ACCESS users, resource providers, ACCESS projects, Science Gateways and/or other developers. These tasks cover all aspects of integration and operations, including coordination, technical integration, and ongoing support activities. Optional tasks detail ways to integrate that are available but not required.

## Operator Information
