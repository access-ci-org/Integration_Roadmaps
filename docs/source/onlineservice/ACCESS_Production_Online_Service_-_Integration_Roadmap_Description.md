# ACCESS Production Online Service

> Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description

## Infrastructure Type(s)

This roadmap integrates online services provided by ACCESS projects and their vendors / partners into the ACCESS operational environment. The roadmap is intended for online services that are visible outside a single ACCESS project and used by other ACCESS projects, resource providers, developers, or ACCESS users. Online services are accessed using a variety of network protocols suited for their function and target audience. Examples include ACCESS websites; Atlassian, GitHub, Google, and Globus services; DNS services; IAM services, and various APIs.

## Summary

This roadmap enumerates the tasks for integrating online services into the ACCESS environment for use by ACCESS users, resource providers, ACCESS projects, Science Gateways and/or other developers. These tasks cover all aspects of integration and operations, including coordination, technical integration, and ongoing support activities. Optional tasks detail ways to integrate that are available but not required.

## Operator Information

This roadmap was defined by ACCESS projects for use primarily by ACCESS projects. ACCESS projects participate in the roadmap development process and should know how to follow this integration roadmap without a hands on concierge. Operators must perform the Required Tasks below and may perform the Optional Tasks below.

See related [*Roadmap Task Timeline*](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GIdAMNlJsCRMR1W3rXnD8IsLrY7qM5DLlFaLrKzAjRo/edit#slide=id.g1f134a7d5b4_1_5).

## Support Information

**Submit a Request**: Operators needing assistance with integration tasks can submit an *ACCESS Integration and Operation Support Request* using instructions on [*this page*](https://operations.access-ci.org/open-operations-request). Pick an “*ACCESS Operational Support Issues*” that best matches your request, or the catch-all issue type “*ACCESS-wide: Provider Integration - Infrastructure Integration and Roadmaps*“.

**Slack Discussion**: ACCESS projects have a Slack channel for discussing the development and application of integration roadmaps. For access, talk to your projects’ participant in the Integration Roadmaps Working Group, or submit a request to be invited to the ***ACCESS-CI \#wg-integration-roadmaps*** Slack channel.
