# Infrastructure Description v3

Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Task

**Task Type(s)**: Coordination  
**Start by phase**: Planning  
**Complete by phase**: Ongoing  
**RP role(s)**: Integration coordinator

## Summary

ACCESS infrastructure that is visible to researchers/users, resource providers, developers, between ACCESS projects, or the broader community must be described. ACCESS resource providers, ACCESS projects, and other ACCESS affiliated online service providers (i.e. science gateways, etc.) enter basic information about their organization and then describe the infrastructure that they operate in the Cyberinfrastructure Description Repository (CiDeR). Audience relevant summaries of these descriptions are displayed in different ACCESS websites.

Initial setup involves the integration coordinator obtaining administrator access to CiDeR so they can authorize others in their organization to enter and maintain infrastructure descriptions. This task should take ~Â½ hour. Organization staff enter initial descriptions and maintain accurate infrastructure descriptions in CiDeR. This task should take ~1 hour/year per infrastructure element.
