## Detailed Instructions

### Creation of an Affinity Group

- [***https://support.access-ci.org/affinity_groups***](https://support.access-ci.org/affinity_groups)

You will need to log-in first to make changes to your group. Your Affinity group will be automatically created and populated but we request that you ensure you have the proper coordinators and profile that best suits your needs. If you do not see your Affinity Group please submit a request via the link at the top of the page or submit a ticket. An Affinity Group is made for each RP and then additional ones can be requested if you would like to form one that targets a specific set of community members who have a common, shared interest in a computational issue, scientific or engineering research endeavor, diversity and inclusion effort, or any other connection point. Each Affinity group will have access to Slack channels, forums, news, and outage alerts, events and training materials.

### News Items

- [*News | ACCESS Support*](https://support.access-ci.org/news)

Please submit news items via the ASP Portal. You will see a box on the right side that says “*Posting News, Do you have news you would like to share with the ACCESS community?*” which will take you to a page that asks for specific details of your news item and the ability to post a news event directly to your/an Affinity group. You will need to be signed-in to ACCESS to submit.

### Events

- [*https://support.access-ci.org/events*](https://support.access-ci.org/events)

Please submit events via the ASP Portal. This link will take you to a listing of all events in a calendar format. You will see a box on the right side that says *“Posting Events, Do you have events or training you would like to share with the ACCESS community?”* which will take you to a page that asks for specific details of your event you would like to post. This can also be shared with your Affinity group. You will need to be signed-in to ACCESS to submit.
