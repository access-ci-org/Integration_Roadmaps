# Knowledge Base v2

Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Task

**Task Type(s)**: Support  
**Start by phase**: Integration  
**Complete by phase**: Operations  
**RP role(s)**: Documentation and knowledge base contact(s)

## Summary

The purpose of this task is to ensure that RPs have provided all of the knowledge base elements that are needed to fully represent their resources to the ACCESS team and the general user community. Components of the information provided will be represented on the ACCESS MATCH Portal (AMP).

The following information should be available through CiDeR to ensure that your resource is properly represented on the ACCESS Portal (RAMPS & AMP).

> 1.1 Summary Knowledge Base Entry for Resource - Confirm summary paragraph describing the Resource Provider offering(s) is available in CiDeR. This will be displayed on AMP but content will be provided via CiDeR API.  
>
> 1.2 RP User Guide - Full User Guide(s) will reside at and be maintained by the RP on their site or in the knowledgebase (Atlassian Confluence) and accessed by the AMP via the confluence repository.  
>
> 1.3 Affinity Group - Ensure an Affinity group is created with coordinators and profile is up to date. Submit events and news items via the ACESS Support Portal (ASP) portal.

## Detailed Instructions

### Creation of an Affinity Group

- [***https://support.access-ci.org/affinity_groups***](https://support.access-ci.org/affinity_groups)

You will need to log-in first to make changes to your group. Your Affinity group will be automatically created and populated but we request that you ensure you have the proper coordinators and profile that best suits your needs. If you do not see your Affinity Group please submit a request via the link at the top of the page or submit a ticket. An Affinity Group is made for each RP and then additional ones can be requested if you would like to form one that targets a specific set of community members who have a common, shared interest in a computational issue, scientific or engineering research endeavor, diversity and inclusion effort, or any other connection point. Each Affinity group will have access to Slack channels, forums, news, and outage alerts, events and training materials.

### News Items

- [*News | ACCESS Support*](https://support.access-ci.org/news)

Please submit news items via the ASP Portal. You will see a box on the right side that says “*Posting News, Do you have news you would like to share with the ACCESS community?*” which will take you to a page that asks for specific details of your news item and the ability to post a news event directly to your/an Affinity group. You will need to be signed-in to ACCESS to submit.

### Events

- [*https://support.access-ci.org/events*](https://support.access-ci.org/events)

Please submit events via the ASP Portal. This link will take you to a listing of all events in a calendar format. You will see a box on the right side that says *“Posting Events, Do you have events or training you would like to share with the ACCESS community?”* which will take you to a page that asks for specific details of your event you would like to post. This can also be shared with your Affinity group. You will need to be signed-in to ACCESS to submit.

### Knowledge Base Service Integrations

ACCESS projects, integrated resources, and central service operators may also request support for integration of the following Knowledge Base services:

- **ACCESS Resource Advisor (ARA)** – [https://ara.access-ci.org/](https://ara.access-ci.org/)  
- **Software Documentation Service (SDS)** – [https://sds.access-ci.org/](https://sds.access-ci.org/)  
- **ACCESS Chatbot (QA Tool)** – [https://support.access-ci.org/tools/access-qa-tool](https://support.access-ci.org/tools/access-qa-tool)  

To request integration of any of these services, please submit a ticket using the ACCESS Support Portal form:

- [Support Portal Request Form](https://access-ci.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2/group/3/create/32)

On the ticket form, please:  
- Under **Request Title** of the form, fill in: *“SDS / ARA / QA Tool integration – [your project or resource name]”*
- Under ACCESS Operational Support Issues, select **Support: OnDemand, Pegasus, Knowledge Base, Affinity Groups, Events, Announcements, Ask.CI, etc.**  
- Complete the required fields and submit.  

ACCESS support staff will review your request and follow up directly.
