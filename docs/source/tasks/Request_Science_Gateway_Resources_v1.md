# Request Science Gateway Resources v1

Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Task

**Task Type(s)**: Coordination, Support  
**Start by phase**: Integration  
**Complete by phase**: Operations  
**Operator role(s)**: PI, CoPI, or gateway administrator

## Summary

Science gateway operators request that their awarded allocation credits be exchanged for computing and storage allocations on specific resource providers resources that advertise as being available to science gateways.

## Prerequisite tasks

1.  The science gateway operator must have an awarded allocation. See the document at [*Request Science Gateway Allocation v1*](Request_Science_Gateway_Allocation_v1.md). Depending on the size of the request, this could take days to weeks to complete.

## Support Information

For assistance with this task see the *Support Information* section in the *Integration Roadmap Description*.

## Detailed Instructions

The gateway provider uses the ACCESS allocation request system to transfer ACCESS credits to particular resource providers. See [*https://allocations.access-ci.org/*](https://allocations.access-ci.org/).

The exchange request may take days or longer before approved by the resource provider.

The science gateway provider uses standard ACCESS procedures to convert ACCESS allocation tokens to computing time or storage on target resources. The gateway provider should make sure that the resource provider supports science gateway usage, which should be included in the resource description.
