**Start by phase**: Planning  
**Complete by phas**e: Ongoing  
**RP role(s)**: Allocations process contact(s)

## Summary

Resource Providers will need to have proper representation for Allocation questions, reviewing RP requests and provide guidance to both ACCESS Allocations staff and review panels. This document details required Integration Instructions, Operating Instructions, Contact Information, and other Helpful Resources for RPs functioning as *Allocations Contacts*. 

## Prerequisite tasks

None

## Support Information

For assistance with this task see the *Support Information* section in the *Integration Roadmap Description*.

## Integration Instructions

The Resource Provider must first identify an Allocations contact for each resource RP makes available for allocations via ACCESS. This contact(s) will work with Allocations and/or other ACCESS tracks to provide documentation/user guides for each of their resources. The contact will be the main liaison for Allocations as well as user community and review panels. RP contact will need to provide available resource information, review proposals of smaller Allocation requests. Contact will need to provide resource information for resource(s) and keep CiDeR updated for the life of resource(s). Create a [*ticket*](https://access-ci.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/2) with subject “Track 1 Roadmaps - allocations contact” or email [*hackwort@psc.edu*](mailto:hackwort@psc.edu) to provide contact details.  
  
Instructions for entering resource information into CiDeR are specified in a later roadmap step: [*Infrastructure Description*](Infrastructure_Description_v2.md)

## Operating Instructions

RPs who are designed as Allocations Contacts, who are responsible for reviewing requests for their resources and ensuring their site's documentation is up to date, are encouraged to utilize the following tools & resources to assist with their involvement in the Allocations process. Feedback related to this document (and ACCESS Allocation Services as a whole) is welcomed through our [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdn-SXokNB_5s0r2SA_S9ZIZWZFlVPRD2OHepTH5HY2YND_zw/viewform). If you’re a new RP, please familiarize yourself with the tools and processes mentioned herein and reach out to Allocations staff for assistance. 

* XRAS ([eXtensible Resource Allocation Service](https://allocations.access-ci.org/about-xras)) 
    * The main tool under constant development and refinement for ACCESS Allocations. The software suite provides distinct interfaces for Submit, Review, and Administration components required for end-to-end services 
* [Allocations Review Site](https://review-access.xras.org/login) 
    * Serves as the mechanism to review requests for your resource(s). We recommend that you bookmark this page!
* [Reviewer Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s0TLyKTXrKFjjVGJxE-7nwyzHfAwX-sjjBOJbsiprf4/edit#)
    * Documents the allocations cycle and review guidelines. We recommend that you regularly refer to this documentation as you complete any and all review assignments
* [Reviewer Training & DEI](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-ENSP1gvqGi5H2w_bKjwr6ocvVJaT-kw) 
    * In order to create an open, inviting, and democratized allocations marketplace various training and reference materials are provided
* [Allocations Queries](https://xacct-admin.access-ci.org/allocations_queries)

    * To request access to this tool, please [create a ticket](https://support.access-ci.org/open-a-ticket)
* [Available Allocation Opportunities](https://allocations.access-ci.org/prepare-requests-overview)
    * Details the four opportunities to request allocations on ACCESS resources
* [ACCESS Credits](https://allocations.access-ci.org/use-credits-overview)
    * Allocations for the first three opportunity levels are awarded in ACCESS Credits
    * A credit exchange rate must be established by the Resource Provider for the systems they will allocate. This is done through the [CyberInfrastructure Description Repository (CiDeR)](https://cider.access-ci.org/login)
        * RPs can contact Allocations if they have questions on setting their exchange rate
* [Resource Catalog](https://allocations.access-ci.org/resources)
    * Summarizes all resources currently available in the ACCESS ecosystem
    * The RP Allocation contact is responsible for contributing and reviewing the descriptions and associated content for each allocated resource (also through CiDeR)
