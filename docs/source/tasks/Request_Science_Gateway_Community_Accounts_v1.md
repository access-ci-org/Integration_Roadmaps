## Detailed Instructions

Community accounts are UNIX accounts on ACCESS resource providers that can be used by a science gateway’s users through the science gateway’s user or programming interface. Science gateway providers request community accounts in individual ticket requests directed to the ACCESS Resources Providers, the ACCESS Integration Coordinator assigned can help make these requsts.

The science gateway provider should confirm that the community accounts are created and accessible. It may take hours to days for accounts to be created after registration.

The science gateway provider may need to take additional, resource provider-specific steps to enable the account. This may include, for example, providing specific IP addresses or registering SSH keys that the science gateway will use when accessing the resource provider.
