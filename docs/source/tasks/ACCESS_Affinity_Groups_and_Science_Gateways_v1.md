A Science Gateway Affinity Group has been requested but may not appear on this site as of the publishing of this document.

Resource providers use affinity groups to communicate with their users, including science gateway providers. The science gateway provider may wish to communicate this information to their users through their own communication channels.

ACCESS science gateway community members and ACCESS staff communicate using the science gateways affinity group. This may for example include changes to policies, new services, and informal support.

Some resource providers may have additional communication channels.
