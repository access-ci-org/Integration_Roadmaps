For assistance with this task see the **Support Information** section in the [Infrastructure Integration Roadmap Description](https://readthedocs.access-ci.org/projects/integration-roadmaps/en/latest/gateway/ACCESS_Integrated_Science_Gateway_-_Integration_Roadmap_Description.html#support-information).

## Detailed Instructions

The science gateway provider must create an [Integration and Operations Request](https://operations.access-ci.org/help)
 - Provide an appropriate title
 - Set *ACCESS Operational Support Issues* to ACCESS-wide: Provider Integration - Infrastructure Integration and Roadmaps 
 - Set *Infrastructure Type:* Science Gateway and specify the *Science gateway name*
 - Include all the details of the gateway in the description. Please use the following template.

```md

```

*Integration coordinator* is the contact person from the science gateway side working with the ACCESS concierge on the 
integration process. 

Once the ticket is created, it will be reviewed by the ACCESS concierge and will get back to you for additional 
information. And then the ACCESS concierge would create/update the information in the ACCESS website. The task is completed 
when the gateway information is published to the ACCESS website.

ACCESS may periodically review registration information to confirm that it is correct. Gateway providers should create 
subsequent tickets in the future to update the information.
