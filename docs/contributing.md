# Introduction

[Integration Roadmaps][integration roadmaps] have [separate tracks][integration roadmap tracks] that roadmap necessary (and optional) tasks for [Resource Providers][resource providers] to accomplish to integrate into the [ACCESS][ACCESS main page] ecosystem.

Our [Code of Conduct can be found here](https://support.access-ci.org/code-conduct). For a general introduction, please see [the general introduction][main-introduction].

# Where can I help?

To _get_ help please see [Getting help][getting-help].

To _provide_ help, we welcome any kind of help including [reporting issues](#reporting-issues), [requesting features](#requesting-features), and making [documentation contributions](#contributing-documentation) following the [contribution conventions](#contribution-conventions).

# Reporting issues

+ Search [ACCESS integration roadmaps issues tracker](https://github.com/access-ci-org/Integration_Roadmaps/issues/)
in case your issue was already reported.

TODO mention recommended wording, tags, etc

# Requesting feature(s)
# Contribution conventions

This repository follows the [GitHub flow][github flow] model as a workflow for collaborating and uses [CommonMark][CommonMark] as the markdown model for documentation.

It is _strongly recommended_ to [test changes locally](#test-locally) before submitting a pull request.

## Branch naming recommendation

When creating a branch, adding the author's name and then a descriptive branch name of the intended commits can be helpful to categorize and track changes:

`user/clear-purpose-of-proposed-changes` (e.g. `mollycule/add-readthedocs-contribute-doc`)

# Contributing code

In order to contribute to the [Integration Roadmaps documentation][documentation], you must first be part of the [access-ci-org organization][ACCESS GitHub organization].

## GitHub -> Read the Docs workflow
In order to contribute to the workflow between the GitHub repo and Read the Docs, you must request to become a maintainer by creating an issue stating your:

+ full name
+ GitHub account name
+ ACCESS affilliation

# Contributing documentation

## For Integration Roadmaps documentation

To contribute to [Integration Roadmap tasks][integration roadmap tasks], here are the recommended steps (following the [Github flow][github flow] model):

+ create a branch following the [branch naming recommendation](#branch-naming-recommendation)
+ create, edit, delete, or rename files inside your branch
+ __IMPORTANT__: [test your changes locally](#test-locally) for any syntax, styling, or broken link errors
+ create a pull request for peer review

# Test locally

```
# Create a Python virtual environment and activate it
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Go to docs/ directory
cd docs/

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build documentation
make html
```

Then, you can see the output in your web browser at `Integration_Roadmaps/docs/build/html/index.html`.
